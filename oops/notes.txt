Object Oriented Programming: 
   Objects:
        - entites in the real world (which has properties)
        - ex: pen, animal, watch
    classes:
        - group of entites
        - ex: school, class
        - attributes + functions
        - classes always start with caps and functions with small

    Encapsulation:
        - The wrapping up if data & method under a single unit.
        - It also implements data hidings
    Constructor:
        - A special method which is nvoked automatically at teh time of obj creation
        - They have same name as class or structure
        - They dont have return type
        - memory allocation happens when constructor is called.
        - types : non-parameterized, parameterized, copy constructor
    Inheritence:
        - When Properties & methods of base class are passed on to a derived class
    Polymorphism:
        - poly -> many
        - morphism -> forms
        - types: compile time(over loading), real time(overriding)
        - overlading -> same method name different parameters
    Abstract:
        - cannot create an instance of Abstract class
        - can have both abstract and non-abstract class methods
    interfaces:
        - blueprint of a class
        - all methods are public abstract & without implementation
        - used to acheieve total abstraction
        - variables in the interfaces are final, public & static
        - multiple Inheritence can be acheieved through interface
    static:
        - used to share same variable or method of a class
    super:
        - used to refer immediate parent class object.
