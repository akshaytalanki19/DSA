Loops are used to intarate through an logic until the given condition is satified
It is used to reduce the number of times to write the same code

we have 3 loops:
        For loops
        while loops
        do-while loops

Syntax:
    1 for loop:
       for(intialization; condition; increment/decrement){
        // logic
        //logic 
       }

    2 while loop:
       intialization
       while(condition){
          // logic
          //logic 
        increment/decrement
       }

    3 do-while
       intialization
       do{
         // logic
        //logic 
        increment/decrement
       }while(condition)

break Statement
      break is used to stop the loop in the middle of the iteration without going to the end of loops condition 

Continue Statement:
    In an loop user wants to skip few particular steps he can use Continue Statement
