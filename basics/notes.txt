Data Types In Java 
  
   Primitive  = {byte, short, char, boolean, long, int, float, double}

   byte = 1byte
   short = 2 bytes
   char = 2 bytes             1 byte = 8 bits
   boolean = 1 byte
   int = 4 bytes
   long=8 bytes
   float = 4 bytes
   double = 8 bytes

   Non-Primitive ={String, Array,class, Object, Interface}


Comments in Java:
       
        // -> indicate commet in a line after this line
        /*
         *  this is the commet that considers every line in btw them will be considered as comments
         */

Input in Java:
  
        Scanner objectName = new Scanner(System.in);

        int -> nextInt
        String -> next() // for single word
               -> nextLine() // for multiple lines or words
               -> nextLine().charAt(0) // for scanning single charecter

Type Conversion:
  
       -> we can only convert data type of similar type (type compatible)
          ex:  int -> float (ok)
               int -> boolean (not ok)
       -> desitination size > source size(type)
          ex:  int -> long (ok)
               long -> int (not ok)
        -> order of sizes:  byte - short - float - long - double

Type Casting:
  
       -> by forcing changing the data type with data loss
          ex:  float a= 12.5f;
                int b = (int)a ;
                // b=12
Type promotion: 
     
       -> java automatically promotes each byte,short, or char operand to int when evaluating an expression 
          ex: 
                 byte a= 1
                 short b= 2
                 char ch='a'
                 int exp= a+b+ch // 1+2+97=100
        -> If one operand is long, float or double then whole expression is promoted to long, float, or double respectively


How Code is running
       
          source code .java (file) -> compiler -> byte code (.class) -> jvm -> native code (based on the system)

Operation in java:
         Arthemetic Operations(binary,Unary)
             Binary:  +,-,*,/,% (need to variables or values)
             Unary:  ++,-- (require only one variable)
         Realational Operation
         Logical Operations
         Bitwise Operation
         Assignment Operations
